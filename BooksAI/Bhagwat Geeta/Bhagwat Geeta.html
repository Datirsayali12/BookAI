        <h3>Chapter 2: Sanskrit Shlok and Its Meaning</h3>
        
        <p>This chapter presents a collection of Sanskrit shlokas from the Bhagwat Geeta along with their English translations, providing readers with the essence and wisdom encapsulated in these verses.</p>
        
        <h2>Shlok 2.47</h2>
        <p>Perform your duty efficiently without attachment to the results.</p>
        <p>One of the key teachings of the Bhagwat Geeta is encapsulated in this shloka, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the action itself rather than being attached to the outcomes. By performing one's duties diligently and selflessly, without being swayed by desires for specific results, one can attain a state of inner peace and fulfillment.</p>
        <p>This shloka reminds individuals to act with sincerity and dedication, leaving aside personal expectations and ego-driven motives. It teaches the value of detachment from the fruits of one's labor, highlighting the significance of selfless service and commitment to one's responsibilities.</p>
        
        <h2>Shlok 3.16</h2>
        <p>One who does not follow the wheel of creation set in motion by the divine, but remains idle, is deluded and sinful.</p>
        <p>In this shloka, the Bhagwat Geeta emphasizes the importance of engaging in one's prescribed duties and responsibilities as part of the cosmic order. By neglecting one's duties and remaining inactive, an individual deviates from the natural flow of creation and incurs negative consequences.</p>
        <p>The shloka underscores the concept of Dharma, or righteous duty, and the necessity of upholding one's role in the grand scheme of existence. It warns against laziness and apathy, urging individuals to participate actively in the cycle of creation and contribute positively to the world around them.</p>
